# Hostel Management System

A Hostel Management System focuses on managing hostel operations, including student registration, room allocation, fee management, complaints, and record maintenance.

Algorithms and Data Analysis Techniques Used:
• Admission / Occupancy Prediction:

o Regression Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) to predict hostel occupancy rates and future admission trends.

• Room Allocation Optimization:

o Optimization Algorithms to efficiently allocate rooms based on availability, capacity, and student preferences while avoiding overbooking.

• Fee Payment Analysis:

o Data Analysis Techniques to track pending fees, identify late payments, and forecast revenue collection.

• Student Feedback Analysis:

o NLP and Text Analytics to analyze student complaints and feedback for improving hostel facilities and services.

Example Algorithms:

• Dynamic Allocation Algorithm:
Used to assign rooms based on availability, room type, and student requirements.

• Decision Trees:
Used to predict student preferences and identify patterns in facility usage.

• Association Rules:
Used to find relationships between student behavior and hostel services.
